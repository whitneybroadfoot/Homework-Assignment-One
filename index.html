        <p> Thanks for visiting my page, I'm going to share a little about myself to see if this formatting is working!
            My name is Whitney and I live in Denver, Colorado with my husband, Jesse. In my free time I enjoy being outside, trying new things, traveling,
            and spending time with my family and friends. My current goal is to visit all 50 States and I have four more to go; Alaska, Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky.
            Originally my heart was set on all Continents by 30, but after Morocco I had to stop once I realized how expensive Antarctica was!
        </p>
        <p> I am originally from Saranac Lake, New York which is part of the National Adirondack Park.
            Unlike most land preserves, about fifty percent of the 6.1 milion acres is privately owned
            and habitated by people. There are more than 10,000 lakes and 30,000 miles of rivers and 
            streams. This is the one thing that makes living in a land locked State difficult for
            me, but you can't beat the Colorado sunshine! Before moving to Denver, I was living in 
            Brooklyn so I got a crash course in City living. The thing I miss most about New York City is the bagels and the public transportation. Denver
            traffic has definitely changed in the six short years I have lived here, and I wish RTD was more diversified.

        <p> Throughout this class I am most looking forward to the creative side of coding once I learn the basics. There are a lot of articles about an
            emerging "travel tech" industry in Denver, so I would like to use my new skills from this class to explore my options with that. I previously
            worked within the production side of Evening News and I can relate to the importance
            of proper structure. Within the show rundowns, camera robotics, or TelePrompter controls, it
            was always crucial to follow the frameworks in place. During breaking news you don't
            have a lot of time to adapt, so the proper systems in place become extremely important.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for reading my page, please be merciful in your grading. I'll leave you now with a Halloween pun in the spirit of our
            first October assignment: Want to know what you'll find on a haunted beach? A Sand-witch!
